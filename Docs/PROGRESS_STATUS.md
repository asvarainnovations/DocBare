# Progress Status

## âœ… Completed

- **Authentication:** Google OAuth and credentials (NextAuth.js, shared with Asvara site)
- **User Management:** Profile, API keys, subscriptions (Cloud SQL/Postgres)
- **File Upload:** Google Cloud Storage integration, metadata in Postgres and Firestore
- **Document Ingestion:** Chunking, embedding, and storage in Firestore
- **RAG Pipeline (Production):**
  - Query embedding via DeepSeek API (or OpenAI/Gemini, configurable)
  - Semantic retrieval using Vertex AI Vector Search (GCP)
  - RAG prompt construction and answer synthesis using DeepSeek LLM
  - Logging of queries, answers, and sources to Cloud SQL (Prisma) and Firestore
  - All API endpoints implemented as Next.js API routes, ready for Cloud Run
- **Chat System:**
  - Chat session/message models in Prisma/Postgres
  - Chat message storage/retrieval in Firestore
  - **Full chat message persistence:** All user and AI messages are saved and loaded reliably from Firestore and Postgres
  - **No duplicate AI responses on reload:** AI is only auto-triggered for the first user message in a new chat, never on page reload
- **RAG Sessions:**
  - Session state, memory, agent state, and results in Firestore
- **Feedback:** User feedback collection and retrieval (Firestore)
- **API Endpoints:** All major endpoints for upload, ingest, query, chat, session, and feedback
- **Ingestion Script:** CLI for bulk document ingestion and embedding (Firestore)
- **Frontend Integration:**
  - Authentication integrated into UI (login, session management)
  - Home page creates new chat session and redirects to chat on first prompt
  - Chat page fetches messages/session metadata, sends messages, displays chat history
  - **Modern Chat UI:**
    - ChatGPT-like sticky chatbox at the bottom
    - Full-width AI responses, right-aligned user bubbles
    - Sidebar with scrollable chat list, fixed height, and proper bottom padding
    - Sidebar chat navigation and dropdown menu (rename/delete)
    - Markdown rendering, feedback UI, and typing indicator
    - Responsive, mobile-friendly, and visually polished
  - Axios for backend HTTP requests
  - RAG/AI response displayed after user message
  - Feedback UI for session rating/comments
  - Loading and error states for all major UI actions
  - TypeScript and NextAuth type safety (session.user.id, type extensions, etc.)
  - **No duplicate AI calls:** Robust logic ensures AI is only called when appropriate
  - **All UI/UX issues fixed:** Sidebar, chatbox, and chat history now match modern standards

## ðŸš§ TODO / In Progress

- **Sidebar:**
  - Bottom is missing of sidebar in chat page (visual gap/fill issue)
- **Chat UI:**
  - AI response formatting and spacing improvements (make markdown, lists, and code blocks more readable)
- **Chat Titles:**
  - Chat title auto-generation and update in sidebar (ensure titles are generated from first prompt and updated in UI)
- **AI Response Handling:**
  - Issues with context length in AI response (handle truncation, long chats, and token limits gracefully)
- **Prisma Document Model:** (issue in /api/upload.ts)
  - `prisma.document` is not yet available; add Document model to Prisma schema and migrate
- **Frontend:**
  - Further polish for chat/session/feedback UI
  - Display RAG session state and results
  - User dashboard for document and session management
- **Admin Tools:**
  - Admin dashboard for monitoring, analytics, and moderation
- **Security:**
  - Add rate limiting, improved error handling, and input validation
  - Add logging and monitoring for production
- **Testing:**
  - Add unit/integration tests for all APIs
- **Docs:**
  - Document all API endpoints and request/response formats
  - Add setup and deployment instructions for contributors
- **Advanced RAG:**
  - Multi-modal support (images, audio)
  - More advanced agent orchestration and tool use
  - Multi-step agentic reasoning and reranking (planned enhancement)
- **SSO / Cross-site Login:**
  - Planned: If a user is logged in at the Asvara site, they should not have to log in again at DocBare (Single Sign-On / shared session).
