thinkingDisplayContent:
```
First, I need to analyze the document provided. The document is titled "NCDRC Delay not condoned in Revision.pdf" and it's an order from the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) in New Delhi. The revision petition number is 1057 of 2022, and it's against an order dated 25/04/2022 from the Punjab State Commission.

The user's query is: "Analyze the document and describe the facts." So, I need to extract and describe the factual elements from this legal order.

Key facts from the document:

- **Parties Involved:**

  - Petitioner: Sher Singh

  - Respondents: Manager, The New India Assurance Company Limited & Another

- **Procedural History:**

  - The revision petition challenges the State Commission's order dated 25.04.2022.

  - The State Commission dismissed an application for condonation of delay (MA No. 567 of 2022) in Appeal No. FA/304/2022.

  - The delay was 3074 days in filing the appeal.

- **Timeline:**

  - The original order from the District Forum was passed on 24.09.2013.

  - The limitation period for filing an appeal is 30 days, which expired on 23.10.2013.

  - The appeal was filed on 20.04.2022, hence the delay of 3074 days.

- **Arguments Presented:**

  - Petitioner's counsel argued that the delay was bonafide and not intentional, and the appeal should be heard on merits.

  - Respondents' counsel supported the State Commission's order.

- **Legal Principles Cited:**

  - The NCDRC referred to several Supreme Court cases on condonation of delay:

    - Ram Lal vs. Rewa Coalfields Limited (AIR 1962 SC 361)

    - RB Ramlingam vs. RB Bhavaneshwari (2009)

    - Anshul Aggarwal vs. New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (2011)

    - Basawaraj vs. The Spl. Land Acquisition Officer (2014)

    - Anil Kumar Sharma vs. United Indian Insurance Co. Ltd. (2015)

    - Lingeswaran vs. Thirunagalingam (2022)

    - Pathapati Subba Reddy vs. The Special Deputy Collector (2024)

  - Key points: "Sufficient cause" must be shown for condonation; the party must act with reasonable diligence; special limitation periods under the Consumer Protection Act must be respected.

- **NCDRC's Decision:**

  - The NCDRC found that the petitioner did not provide specific details or reasons for the delay.

  - The State Commission rightly dismissed the condonation application.

  - The revision petition is dismissed, with no order as to costs.

Now, I need to structure my response. Since the user asked to "describe the facts," I should present the facts clearly and concisely, focusing on the key elements without delving too deep into legal analysis unless needed.

My response should be professional, in line with Indian legal terminology, and reference the document appropriately.

Finally, I'll format the response as per the guidelines: only the final user-facing response, no internal pipeline steps.

prompt2: "what is the summary of the judgement provided in pdf"

First, the user is asking me to analyze the document and describe the facts, and then specifically to provide a summary of the judgment from the PDF. The document content provided is a judgment from the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) in India.

I need to follow my guidelines. I am DocBare, an AI legal analyst specializing in Indian Law. I should use the reasoning content formatting for my thinking, but the final response should be only the user-facing content, without internal pipeline steps.

The document is clearly a legal judgment, so I need to analyze it in the context of Indian law. The user wants a summary of the judgment, so I should extract the key facts and the ruling.

Let me recall the analysis pipeline:


1. **Task Classification:** This is an analysis task, not drafting. I need to analyze the document.


2. **Document Type Identification:** The document is a judgment/order from the NCDRC, specifically a Revision Petition.


3. **Objective Extraction:** User wants a description of facts and a summary of the judgment.


4. **Jurisdiction Analysis:** This is under the Consumer Protection Act in India, handled by the NCDRC.


5. **Context Summarization:** Key facts include the delay in filing an appeal, the number of days delayed, and the court's reasoning.


6. **Legal Intent Determination:** The purpose is to understand why the delay was not condoned and the legal principles applied.


7. **Structural Outline:** For the summary, I should structure it with key points: parties, issue, decision, reasoning.


8. **Apply Indian Legal Principles:** Reference to Supreme Court cases and the Consumer Protection Act.


9. **Consistency Check:** Ensure it aligns with Indian legal standards.


10. **Length Control:** Keep it concise but comprehensive.


11. **Output Formatting:** Professional Indian legal format.


12. **Clarification:** No unclear points here; the document is provided.

Now, for the reasoning content formatting, I need to structure my thinking in clear sections with headers, but this is for internal use. However, the final response should not include this; it should be the analysis itself.

The user said: "Analyze the provided document content in relation to the user's query." But in the system prompt, it says to provide only the final response, no internal steps. I need to ensure that my response is the final analysis.

Re-reading the system prompt: "Provide ONLY the final, user-facing response" and "NO internal pipeline steps or analysis markers". So, I should not show my reasoning in the response; I should just give the summary.

But the prompt also says: "Use this knowledge to enhance your Indian legal analysis and ensure accuracy." Referring to the Legal Knowledge Base Context, but it's just chunk IDs, not actual content. I think I need to ignore that as it's placeholder text.

The Legal Knowledge Base Context has three chunks, but they are just IDs like "34792ce0-7f9e-48d4-b944-09fb699423f3-chunk670". This might be a system error or placeholder. I should proceed with the document content provided.

Document content is the judgment text. Let me summarize it.

Key facts from the document:

- Revision Petition No. 1057 of 2022 filed by Sher Singh against The New India Assurance Company.

- Challenges the order of Punjab State Commission dated 25.04.2022, which dismissed an application for condonation of delay in filing an appeal.

- The delay was 3074 days in filing the First Appeal against a District Forum order dated 24.09.2013.

- Limitation period for appeal is 30 days, so appeal should have been filed by 23.10.2013, but filed on 20.04.2022.

- State Commission did not condone the delay, and NCDRC upheld that decision.

- NCDRC cited various Supreme Court judgments on condonation of delay, emphasizing that sufficient cause must be shown, and the party must act with diligence.

- The petitioner failed to provide specific reasons or details for the delay.

- Revision petition dismissed.

Summary of judgment: The NCDRC dismissed the revision petition, affirming the State Commission's decision not to condone the delay of 3074 days in filing the appeal, as the petitioner did not demonstrate sufficient cause for the delay.

Now, for the response, I need to provide a concise summary in professional Indian legal format.

Structure the response:

- Briefly introduce the case.

- State the facts.

- Summarize the decision and key legal principles.

- Keep it clear and to the point.

Finally, since the user asked for "the summary of the judgement", I should focus on that.

Analysis of NCDRC Judgment: Revision Petition No. 1057 of 2022****Case Title:** Sher Singh vs. Manager, The New India Assurance Company Limited & Anr.  
**Forum:** National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), New Delhi  
**Decided On:** 20 May 2024  
**Presiding Member:** Hon'ble AVM J. Rajendra, AVSM VSM (Retd.)

### **Facts of the Case:**
1. **Background:** The petitioner, Sher Singh, filed a Revision Petition under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, challenging the order dated 25.04.2022 of the Punjab State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (State Commission).  
2. **Original Dispute:** The State Commission had dismissed an application (MA No. 567/2022) seeking condonation of delay in filing a First Appeal (FA No. 304/2022) against an order of the District Forum dated 24.09.2013.  
3. **Delay Involved:** The First Appeal was filed with a delay of 3,074 days. The limitation period for filing an appeal is 30 days from the date of the District Forum's order (which expired on 23.10.2013), but the appeal was filed only on 20.04.2022.  
4. **Petitioner's Argument:** The petitioner contended that the delay was bonafide, not intentional, and the State Commission should have condoned it to decide the case on merits.  
5. **Respondent's Position:** The insurance company supported the State Commission's order, arguing that the delay was unjustified.

### **Summary of the Judgment:**
The NCDRC dismissed the Revision Petition, upholding the State Commission's refusal to condone the delay. Key aspects of the ruling include:

1. **Legal Principles Applied:**  
   - The Commission relied on Supreme Court precedents (e.g., *Ram Lal vs. Rewa Coalfields Ltd.*, *Anshul Aggarwal vs. NOIDA*, *Basawaraj vs. Special Land Acquisition Officer*) to emphasize that condonation of delay requires proof of "sufficient cause." - "Sufficient cause" means the party must demonstrate diligence, absence of negligence, and bonafide intentions. Courts cannot condone delay on equitable grounds if the explanation is unsatisfactory.  
   - Special limitation periods under the Consumer Protection Act are strict to ensure expeditious adjudication. Entertaining highly belated appeals defeats this objective.

2. **Reasoning for Dismissal:**  
   - The petitioner failed to provide specific details, dates, or evidence to justify the 3,074-day delay. The application for condonation (MA No. 567/2022) was not even placed on record. - The NCDRC noted that the petitioner did not act with reasonable diligence, and the delay was inordinate. The State Commission correctly exercised its discretionary power by dismissing the condonation application. - The Revision Petition itself had a 25-day delay, which was condoned by the NCDRC based on grounds in IA No. 7796/2022, but the substantive delay in the appeal remained unexplained.

3. **Outcome:**  
   - The impugned order of the State Commission was found legal and regular. The Revision Petition was dismissed with no order as to costs. - The decision reinforces that courts must apply limitation laws rigorously, and condonation is not a matter of right but a discretionary relief contingent on satisfactory explanation.

**Key Takeaway:** This judgment underscores the strict approach Indian courts adopt toward condonation of delay in consumer cases, prioritizing statutory limitation periods over equitable considerations unless compelling reasons are proven.
